There are many books and online resources that
discuss Islamic astronomical computation, e.g., Islamic 
prayer hours, the qibla direction, and the data related to 
Hijri dates.
I'm listing here only my own work that provides
the scientific background, algorithms, and computational 
techniques underlying the Minaret program.
Download links to some of my own computer source code are also given:

<li>S. Kamal Abdali: <i>Prayer Schedules for North 
America</i>, American Trust Publications, Indianapolis, 
Indian, 1978. 
<p>The appendices in this book give detailed algorithms for 
computing prayer hours and the qibla.

<p>This paper and the simultaneously done research of Dr. M. 
Ilyas [reference needed] were the first to formulate the 
concept of <i>visibility separator curve</i> that has come to be
widely used in predicting the visible crescent moon and 
in calculating the Hijri calendar accurately.

<li>Rashid Ahmad Ludhianavi: <i>Ahsan al-Fataawa</i>
(in Urdu), Vol 2, H.M. Saeed Co., Karachi, 1400 AH (= 1980).
<p>This book contains the complete FORTRAN 
source code listing of my program used to compute the 
schedules published in Ref.1 above. 
The book also contains the complete FORTAN 
source code of my program to compute the 
crescent's visibility. 
Incidentally, these were the first computer 
programs for solving the above problems.
See below for downloading the updated versions of these source codes. 
<p>The book also contains reprints of several of 
Mufti Ludhianavi's previously published booklets on 
Islamic astronomical computations.
Of these, <i>Irshaad al-Aabid</i> is excellent.
Another booklet critically reviews a 1944 article by Allama 
Mashriqi about the qibla in which he mocks the 
&quot;mullas&quot; for their ignorance of science.
The retort by Mufti Ludhianavi is both informative and entertaining.
In all fairness, here the Mufti (calling himself a 
&quot;humble mulla&quot;) shows much superior 
knowledge and expertise about the qibla problem 
than the Allama who was renowned for his mathematical
wizardry!

praytimer.zip</a>. 
Portable C source code for prayer time and qibla computations. 
The program produces daily, monthly, or yearly prayer 
schedules for any location. 
It can be used interactively or in batch mode. 
For TeX source code of prettyprinted schedules, see the 
program prayscheduler below.

(ca. 1987).
Portable C source code for prayer time and qibla computations. 
The program produces TeX source code for pleasant looking prayer 
schedules.

<li><a href="http://geomete.com/minaret/qibtimer.zip">
qibtimer.zip</a>.
Fortran source code to compute the times at which the shadow of 
a 
vertical object makes simple angles (multiples of 45 defrees) 
with 
the qibla, thus making it possible to determine the qibla 
without 
knowing the North direction and without having to measure 

arbitrary angles.

<li><a href="http://geomete.com/minaret/crescalc.zip">
crescalc.zip</a>.
Fortran source code to predict whether a waxing lunar crescent 
would be 
visible on any particular evening in any particular 
location.

<p>Minaret is freeware.  
Please enjoy it! 
Its many features are best mastered by experimenting 
with it.
