<h1>The File Menu</h1>

Use this menu to open, save, and print the monthly or yearly prayer 
schedules and qibla charts computed by Minaret.  

<a name="save">
<h2>Save/Save As</h2>
</a>

By using the <b>Save</b> or <b>Save as</b> item from the <b>File</b> 
menu, you can save into a file the contents of the text window in front.  
You may like to save the schedule in a file for possibly reformatting 
it with a word processor.  
If you use a word processor for printing a schedule, then first set 
the font to a fixed width font before opening the file.  
This will keep the tabular columns neatly aligned. 

<a name="print">
<h2>Print</h2>
</a>

By selecting <b>Print</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, you can print 
the contents of the text window in front. 

<p>When text files are printed using <b>Print</b> in this menu, 
the RETURN (ascii 13) and FORMFEED (ascii 12) characters will cause 
line skip and page eject, respectively.  
The <b>File</b> menu is intended only for use with the text files 
generated by Minaret.  
In particular, it will not work on non-text files, large text files 
(more than 32K characters), or text files with very long lines.
