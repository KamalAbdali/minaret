<h1>The Location Menu</h1>

<a name="openGzt">
<h2>Open Gazetteer</h2>
</a>

This is the first menu you should look at.  
Minaret contains a built-in gazetteer with geographical information 
about 700 cities initially.  
At any time, one of these is the <b>Current Location</b> for which 
all computations are done.  

<p>To specify any location as the <b>Current Location</b>, click on 
the <b>Open Gazetteer</b> item in the <b>Location</b> menu.  
A large window will appear in which the box at top left shows 
the <b>Current Location</b>. 
Below the box is an alphabetically ordered scroll list of all cities 
in the Gazetteer.  
As you scroll through this list and click on various location 
names, the stored geographical data about them appears in the 
boxes at right.  
If your desired location is already the <b>Current Location</b>, 
then you can simply close the Gazetteer by pressing on the 
<b>CLOSE</b> button.  
Otherwise, if your desired location is in the Gazetteer, select it, 
then press the <b>Make it Current Location</b> button.  
All subsequent computations will be done for that city, 
even when you exit and relaunch Minaret. 

<p>You can edit the Gazetteer to add and delete locations, 
and to modify information about existing locations.

<p>To add a new location, open the Gazetteer, then press the 
<b>Create New Entry</b> button. 
A new blank entry is created.  
Edit the boxes and set the radio buttons at right to supply 
the new city’s name and the geographical data for it.  
You will need to know the latitude, longitude, zone time 
relative to Greenwich, and whether or not the place observes 
Daylight Savings Time.  

<p>If you check the box indicating that the city observes 
Daylight Saving Time, then the <b>Specify Dates</b> 
button will become enabled.  
Press this button to bring up the window for specifying 
the start and end of Daylight Saving Time period. 
Different rules are used around the world to specify this period. 
For example, for North American locations that observe 
Daylight Saving Time, it begins on the second Sunday of March 
and ends on the first Sunday of November.  
Or, in Syria, Daylight Saving Time begins on March 30 and 
ends on September 21. 
For specifying start and end, you can choose either a date 
such as March 30 or a weekday such as the last Sunday of March.  
After pressing the appropriate radio buttons, close the box 
to return to the Gazetteer.  
Verify the information for your city, then press 
<b>Update/add this location</b> to add the city to the gazetteer. 

<p>NOTE: Editing the Gazetteer doesn’t change the current location.  
If you want to do computations for a city not in the Gazetteer, 
first edit the Gazetteer to add that city, then make the city 
the <b>Current Location</b>.

<p>NOTE: If you edit the information about the current location,  
then after editing you need to make that city the
<b>Current Location</b> <em>once again</em>. 

<p>To delete a location, select it in the Gazetteer, then 
press <b>Remove this location</b>.  
Only about 1000 cities are allowed in the Gazetteer, so you may 
need to delete some locations to make room for others.  

<a name="gztSize">
<h2>Gazetteer Size</h2>
</a>

To find out how many cities are currently in the Gazetteer, 
select the <b>Gazetteer size</b> item. 

<a name="restoreGzt">
<h2>Restore Factory-set Gazetteer</h2>
</a>

The changes made to the Gazetteer by editing it accumulate from 
session to session.  
To revert to the original Gazetteer supplied with the program, 
use the menu item <b>Restore factory-set gazetteer</b>.  
You may like to do this before any other computation in case 
your copy of Minaret is not an original distribution from the author, 
and you’re not sure of the validity of the stored data. 

<p>NOTE: At the time of quitting a Minaret session in which 
you’ve edited the Gazetteer, you have the option of saving 
or discarding the changes you’ve made within that session.  
Should you respond No, the Gazetteer remains unchanged for 
that session, but any changes saved in previous sessions stay intact.
(You shoud select No when you've done computations for some 
temporary locations that you do not wish to permanently add
to the gazetteer.)  
On the other hand, <b>Restore factory-set gazetteer</b> 
throws away the changes accumulated through all the previous sessions 
in which the Gazetteer was edited.
