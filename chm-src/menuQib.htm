<h1>The Qibla Menu</h1>

<a name="qibAngle">
<h2>Angle from North</h2>
</a>

<b>Select Angle from North</b> to find the direction of the Qibla.  
(Be sure to first set the <b>Current Location</b> using the Location menu.)   
The angle is given from the geographical, not magnetic, North.  
Since it is not always easy to accurately either determine North or 
measure angles, the shadow method described below is generally 
a better way to determine the Qibla. 

<a name="diagDay">
<h2>Shadow Diagram for a Day</h2>
</a>

<b>Shadow diagram for a day</b> lets you determine the Qibla 
by observing shadows, without having to know the North direction.  
You get a diagram which shows the directions in which the shadow of 
a vertical object points at certain times of the day.  
One of the lines in the diagram is marked with a Q.  
This is the direction of the Qibla.  
The times have been so computed that the angle between the Qibla 
and the shadow is a multiple of 45 degrees, quite easy to measure.  
(If there is a time on the line marked Q, then the Qibla is exactly 
in the same direction as the shadow at that time, and you don’t 
have to measure any angle.)  

<p>Experiment with this menu using different dates to see the relation 
between the Qibla and the shadow.  
Summer dates give you more opportunities to determine 
the Qibla using the shadow method. 
The shadows near the time of noon are short and change direction 
rapidly. 
So whenever you have a choice, use the times as far from noon 
as possible.

<a name="chartMonth">
<h2>Shadow Chart for a Month/Year</h2>
</a>

Select <b>Shadow chart for a month</b> or <b>Shadow chart for a year</b> 
to display tables of the shadow information in a text window.  
See remarks under the <b>Prayer</b> menu for printing and saving 
the contents of the window. 

<a name="qibKaaba">
<h2>Locations Near the Kaaba</h2>
</a>

The computed value of the qibla is not meaningful for locations very close to the Kaaba or its diametrically 
opposite location in the Pacific Ocean.  
For example, the qibla computed for the city of Makkah itself will be 
a random number. 
This is not a shortcoming of Minaret as you don't need to 
<i>compute</i> the qibla when you live near the Kaaba!
