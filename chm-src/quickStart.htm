<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<a name="install">
<h2>Installing Minaret</h2>
</a>

<ol>
<li> Create a new directory, for example, C:\Minaret.</li>
<li> Copy the downloaded file Minaret.zip into that directory.</li>
<li> Unzip Minaret.zip using a utility.
     In Windows, double-clicking on the zip file usually does this 
     automatically.
     You can also do it using a utility such as 7zip or Winzip.</li>
</ol>

All the files needed to run Minaret are in the Minaret directory.  
The *.DLL and *.OCX files may be moved to the directory Windows\System.  
But doing this may overwrite other versions of these files, 
and affect proper execution of other applications.  
It is best to simply leave these files in the Minaret directory.

<a name="run">
<h2>Running Minaret</h2>
</a>

Use the <b>Run...</b> menu from Window's 
<b><i>Start</i></b>, or double-click on Minaret.exe in Windows Explorer. 

<a name="setCurLoc">
<h2>Setting Current Location</h2>
</a>

When Minaret starts, go to the <b>Location Menu</b>, 
and select <b>Open Gazetteer</b> from it.  
A large window will open.  
The box at top left shows the <b>Current Location</b>.  
This is the city for which Minaret does all computations, 
such as calculating prayer hours or the qibla direction, 
converting calendar dates, etc.  
From the scroll list below that box, click on your city.  
(If your city is not in the Gazetteer, then you have to enter 
your city’s name and geographical information by first pressing 
the <b>Create New Entry</b> button.)  
The name and geographical data will appear in the boxes at right.  
Verify the information, then press the <b>Make it Current Location</b> 
button.  
Then press the <b>Close</b> button to close the gazetteer.

<h2>Setting Options</h2>
</a>

There are some jurisprudential variations in determining the prayer 
times for fajr, asr, and isha.  
Go to the <b>Options</b> menu, and select the methods according to 
your preferences.

<a name="results">
<h2>Getting Results</h2>
</a>

Now you are ready to compute with Minaret.  
Use the <b>Prayer</b> menu to compute prayer hours for any day, 
month, or year.  
Use the <b>Qibla</b> menu for determining the qibla direction.  
Use the <b>Calendar</b> menu to convert dates between the Hijri and 
Gregorian calendars or to get New Moon information helpful 
in determining Hijri dates.
