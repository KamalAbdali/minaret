<h1>The Prayer Hours Menu</h1>

<a name="hoursDay">
<h2>Prayer Hours for a Day</h2>
</a>

Select <b>Prayer hours a day</b> to get the five prayer hours plus 
the time of sunrise for any desired date.  
(Be sure to first set <b>Current Location</b> using the 
Location menu.)  
Minaret will present you a window in which the prayer hours for 
the current date (today) are shown at right.  
The left side of the window has boxes to specify another date.  
To compute prayer hours for another date, fill in the date information, 
then press the <b>Recompute</b> button.  
Do this for as many dates as you wish.  
When you’re done, press the Close button to close the window.

<p>If you hear a beep when trying to compute prayer hours, 
then you have typed either an illegal date or a date outside 
the period 1901-2200 A.D.

<a name="schHijMonth">
<h2>Prayer Schedule for a Hijri Month</h2>
</a>

When you select this item, Minaret will present you with a dilaog box 
in which to set the Hijri month and year.  
After filling this information, press OK to get the schedule 
for a Hijri month.
This menu item is most commonly utilized for the month of Ramadan
since the schedule then contains the times relevant to fasting.

<a name="schMonth">
<h2>Prayer Schedule for a Month/Year</h2>
</a>

Select <b>Prayer schedule for a month</b> or <b>Prayer schedule for a year</b> 
to display a table of prayer hours in a text window.  
Minaret will first present you a dialog box in which you should fill 
in the month or the year for which the schedule is desired.  
For a <i>perpetual schedule</i> for a year, type "0" (zero) for the year.  
Perpetual schedules are further discussed below.  

<p>Since prayer hours depend upon the sun’s position, it is more practical 
to tabulate the Islamic prayer schedule according to the dates in 
the Western, solar calendar.  
For a fixed location, prayer times for any particular date in 
the Western calendar vary very little from year to year, 
and for all practical purposes repeat themselves in four year cycles.  
(Find this out for yourself by computing prayer hours for the same 
dates in different years.)  
If you want to print annual prayer schedules, I strongly recommend 
using zero for the year.  
This doesn’t mean the year zero B.C. or A.D., but is a special value 
to cause Minaret to print a perpetual calendar in which 
the times are essentially the average of the four years of a cycle.  
It is silly to print a new calendar every year, since the yearly 
variation is seldom more than a minute. 

<p>If, according to the gazetteer, the <b>Current Location</b> 
observes Daylight Saving Time, then Minaret adds one hour 
to all times computed for the dates in the Daylight Saving Time period.  
The period is determined by the gazetteer settings made using 
<b>Specify Dates</b> while editing the gazetteer.  
If the year is zero (that is, if a perpetual schedule is desired), 
then the adjustment is made throughout the period from April to October.  
This makes perpetual prayers somewhat inconvenient for locations 
observing Daylight Saving Time with rules different from those used 
in North America.

<p>NOTE: Islamic prayer times are computed from their well-known 
astronomical definitions.  
(See, for example, the appendices A and B in the book
<i>Prayer Schedules for North America</i> compiled by 
S. Kamal Abdali and published in 1978 by American Trust 
Publications, Indianapolis, Indiana.)
  
<p>NOTE: Under certain conditions (for example, on certain 
summer dates 
at very high latitudes), the traditional astronomical definitions 
do not work, and the equations defining prayer times 
do not have solutions.  
Minaret prints "??" when it cannot compute a  prayer time.
