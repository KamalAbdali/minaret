<h1>The Calendar Menu</h1>

<a name="dateConvert">
<h2>Date Conversion</h2>
</a>

Select <b>Date conversion</b> to convert back and forth between Hijri 
and Western dates.
(The latter are usually referred to as <i>CE</i> or 
<i>Common Era</i> dates.)
Minaret accepts as input any date between Muharram 1, 1 A.H. 
(July 16, 622 A.D.) and Zul Hijja 30, 4000 A.H. 
Minaret presents you with a dialog box in which Hijri dates can be set 
in the right column, and Western dates can be set in the left column, 
by filling boxes and setting radio buttons.
Set the date in one calendar, then press the <b>arrow</b> button 
pointing towards the other calendar.

<p>A date outside this range or an illegal date will causes Minaret 
to beep.  
The conversion algorithm used in Minaret is based on some heuristic 
criteria derived from the observed records of moon sightings.

<p>You can use <b>Date conversion</b> to also compute the day of 
the week for any desired Western or Hijri date.
Just set the given date in the appropriate calebdar, then press the 
<b>arrow</b> button to convert it to the other calendar.
After conversion, Minaret also displays the day of the week for 
that date.

<a name="newMoon">
<h2>New Moon Phase</h2>
</a>

Select <b>New moon phase</b> to get the time of the astronomical 
new moon phase just preceding the start of any Hijri month.  
Minaret computes the time of this phenomenon with an accuracy of 
about two minutes, and displays it both as the Greenwich Mean Time 
and as the Zone time for the <b>Current Location</b>.  

<p>CAUTION: It is crucial to realize that the moon is invisible 
at the astronomical new moon phase.
The visible crescent moon which starts a Hijri month should not 
be confused with the astronomical new moon.
The formation of the visible lunar crescent takes anywhere from 
about 18 to about 42 hours from the time of the astronomical new moon
phase.  
Although a few younger sightings of the moon have been reported, 
they are extremely rare, and would be possible only under 
certain special circumstances.  

<a name="moonAge">
<h2>Moon’s Age</h2>
</a>

Select <b>Moon’s age</b> to determine the age of moon at any 
desired time 
on any date in the period 640--4500 A.D.  
To predict approximately whether the lunar crescent will be visible 
on a certain evening, you can find the time of sunset on that date 
by selecting <b>Prayer hours for a day</b> in the <b>Prayer hours</b> 
menu, then find the moon’s age at that time by selecting 
<b>Moon’s age</b> in the <b>Calendar</b> menu.  
If the age turns out to be less than 18 hours, then it is quite unlikely 
that the crescent will be visible that evening.  
Of course, the first visibility of the crescent depends on several 
other factors too. 

<a name="cresVisibility">
<h2>Note on the Crescent's Visibility</h2>
</a>

Every month, the locations where the crescent moon is visible 
and those where it is not visible happen to be separated on 
the rectangular (Mercator) map of the earth by a curve called 
the <i>visibility curve</i>.
(See S. Kamal Abdali: 
&quot;On the Crescent's Visibility&quot;,<i>Al-Ittihad</i>, 
Vol 16 Nos 1&ndash;2, 1979.
<a href="http://geomete.com/abdali/papers/moon.pdf">
link to pdf
</a>).  
The visibility separator curve is a parabola which is 
concave to the west 
and has a different position on the earth every month. 
The crescent’s visibility is therefore a local phenomenon.  
That is, it is quite possible for the crescent moon to be seen 
from some location but not from the locations east of it.  

<p>For practical reasons, if the crescent moon is visible from some 
location in a region, such as a country or a group of countries 
like western Europe, then all locations in that region start 
the new Hijri month.  
So for calendar computations, you may like to use a location 
at the western edge of the appropriate region.  
For example, to determine the start of Ramadan in USA, you may like 
to set the location to San Diego, CA or some other western city.
