<h1>The Options Menu</h1>

There are some jurisprudential variations in the methods people use 
to determine certain prayer times.  
This menu lets you select the methods according to your preference.

<a name="asr">
<h2>Asr Time</h2>
</a>

The time of the asr prayer is determined using the concept of 
<b>shadow ratio</b>. 
The shadow ratio for a vertical object at any time is defined 
to be the quantity: 

<p>(the length of shadow at the given time 
<br>&ndash;  the &quot;residual&quot; shadow 
of the object at noon)
<br> /  (the object height). 

<p>At noon the shadow ratio is zero by definition.
As the afternoon progresses, the shadows start 
lengthening, and the shadow ratio ratio keeps increasing.
The Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence considers 
the time of asr to begin when the shadow ratio in the 
afternoon becomes equal to 2.
According to the other schools, the asr time begins when 
the shadow ratio becomes 1.
You can set the shadow ratio according to your
preference by setting the <b>Asr Time</b> item
in the <b>Options</b> menu.

<a name="fajr">
<h2>Fajr/Isha Determination Methods</h2>
</a>

For fajr and isha, the time is usually determined by the Sun’s angle 
of depression below the horizon.  
If this value is taken to be 18 degrees, then fajr coincides 
with the astronomical twilight.  
This seems acceptable for temperate latitudes.  
But at higher latitudes, say above 42 degrees, the resulting times 
for fajr and isha are too impractical (fajr too early, 
isha too late, and the duration of fast too long).  
So many people compute prayer schedules by setting this angle 
to 15 degrees.

<p>At latitudes higher than 50 degrees, such as for cities in 
Northern Europe, it is impossible on certain dates to determine 
fajr and isha times by taking the value of the sun's depression 
to be 18 (or even 15) degrees.
This is so because on those dates the sun doesn't descend sufficiently 
below the horizon to attain that angle of deprression.
So people in some of those cities compute the fajr and isha times 
to be at 90 minutes from sunrise/sunset.
For latitudes above 66 1/2 degrees, of course, even sunrise 
and sunset are not always defined.

<p>By using the menu items in the <b>Option</b> menu,
you can choose the determination method for fajr/isha,
as well as the corresponding values of sun's angle or interval 
from sunrise/set, according to your own preferences.
